## FAQs

**Q**: How to change the starting semester/ total number of semesters?

A: In the course planner, click on the cog button ‚öôÔ∏è on the block for the first semester.

**Q:** Why is the course planner giving me a warning even though my plan is valid?

A: The course database is fetched from [HKUST Class Schedule and Quota](https://w5.ab.ust.hk/wcq/cgi-bin/) using the script in `data/courses.js`. It is far from perfect, so do expect inaccuries. If you encounter them, please notify me by [creating an issue](https://github.com/rextse04/credit-planner/issues).

**Q:** Why does the app tell me to manually re-check my plan when the database is updated? Isn't this done automatically by the app?

A: For performance reasons, this planner uses lazy checking, i.e. it only checks the courses affected by your edits to the plan every time you modify it. If you want to manually re-check a specific course, you can click on the input box for its code and click away. When there is a big update to the database, it is recommended you do a manual re-checking of the entire plan by opening the hamburger menu at the top left corner of the app and clicking "Recheck plan".

**Q**: How does the requirements checker work? Can I match multiple courses with one course code? Can I add more complicated logic into my requirements?

A: See [this page](/GUIDE.md).
